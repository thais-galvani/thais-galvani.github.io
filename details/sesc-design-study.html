            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12">
            <p class="text-big">Sesc is a Brazilian institution that offers a diverse program, including courses, exhibitions, theater, concerts, 
                libraries, sports, and even affordable lodging. My goal with this study is to explore a visual identity that better connects with 
                the audience and reflects everything Sesc has to offer.

            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12">
            <p class="text-big">In an increasingly digital world, Sesc stands out by promoting community-driven, in-person, and hands-on activities 
                such as sports, craft workshops, drawing, painting, and environmental education. To reflect this essence on the website, I drew 
                inspiration from the physical world—taking cues from printed program materials, building signage, and posters for films and events. 
                Sesc is a place of connection, where tactile experiences and physical materials play a big role. I wanted to bring that feeling into 
                the interface through the layout of elements and the use of more soft colors.

                <h2> How could we measure the impact? </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12">
            <p class="text-big">To assess the impact of the new design, it’s important to track metrics like bounce rate and time on page, which 
                indicate user engagement. Clicks and interactions help determine if navigation has improved, while conversions, such as event 
                sign-ups and registrations, measure the redesign’s effectiveness. Tools like heatmaps and usability tests can identify friction points, 
                and user feedback provides qualitative insights into the experience. These analyses help evaluate whether the changes have truly enhanced 
                the audience’s connection with Sesc.
