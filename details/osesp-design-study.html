            <p class="text-big">I chose a cultural institution: Osesp which has its home in the renowned Sala São Paulo, 
                one of the world's finest concert halls. Located in a beautifully restored train station, 
                the venue combines architectural grandeur with state-of-the-art acoustics, providing an 
                unparalleled experience for audiences and musicians alike. Osesp brings classical music to life 
                in this remarkable space, delivering exceptional performances and inspiring music lovers from all backgrounds.

                <h2> Improvements and visual decisions </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12">
            <p class="text-big">I focused on creating a more dynamic and inclusive website, drawing inspiration from the movement and rhythm 
                of sound itself. My goal was to reflect the energy and fluidity of music through interactive and engaging elements. The redesign 
                is deeply influenced by the essence of the concert experience: the expressive motion of the conductor’s baton and the harmonious 
                atmosphere of Sala São Paulo, with its wooden details and warm lighting. </p>

            <p class="text-big">
                Typography played a key role in making the website feel visually inclusive. I opted for clean, sans-serif fonts, avoiding light 
                and overly serifed typefaces that often evoke a sense of classical exclusivity or premium aesthetics. This choice aimed to create a 
                more approachable and contemporary look, aligning with the broader goal of making classical music feel accessible to everyone. 
                These elements came together to blend movement, emotion, and inclusivity, enhancing the overall user experience.

                <h2> How could we measure the impact? </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12">
            <p class="text-big">I would prioritize metrics that evaluate shifts in audience perception and engagement, addressing the historical stigma 
                of classical music as exclusive and inaccessible. The new visual identity is designed to break this barrier, democratizing access and 
                positioning music as something for everyone. </p>

            <p class="text-big">
                To measure the success of this initiative, I would analyze metrics such as completed ticket purchases, time spent on concert-related 
                pages, and interactions with dynamic, sound-inspired features. Additionally, I would track new user sign-ups, the percentage of first-time 
                concertgoers, and whether these efforts are attracting new audiences without alienating the existing loyal patrons. Surveys and user 
                feedback would further provide insights into whether the new design resonates emotionally, capturing the energy of live performances and 
                the inclusive atmosphere of Sala São Paulo. By combining behavioral data and user sentiment, we can clearly understand if the redesign 
                is successfully expanding reach while retaining its core audience.
